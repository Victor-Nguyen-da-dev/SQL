## Introduction

Welcome to my SQL Project Portfolio, my dive into the data job market focusing on `Data Analyst` jobs. This project is my exploration into grasping the top-paying jobs, skills that are in-demand, and the junction between high demand and high paying in this job field.

## Background

The motivation behind this project is to enhance my skills in diving into data as well as allowing me to better understand the data analyst job market better. Through recognizing the most paid and in demand skills, it allows me to enhance myself suitably for the current job market and nagivate through it with more precise targeting.

The data for this analysis is from [Luke Barousse’s SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?

## Tools I Used

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

## Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn

Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.
